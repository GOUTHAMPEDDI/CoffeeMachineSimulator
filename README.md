## Introduction -
The Coffee Machine Simulator is a simple, interactive program that emulates the functionality of a coffee machine. This project was created to provide users with a virtual coffee machine experience, allowing them to select and purchase different types of coffee, manage ingredients, and keep track of earnings in a fun and interactive way.

The Coffee Machine Simulator is designed to be a user-friendly and engaging application that simulates a real coffee machine. It is suitable for both coffee enthusiasts who want to explore different coffee options and maintainers who need to manage ingredients and revenue.
## Features -
The Coffee Machine Simulator supports the following features:

* Buy Coffee: Users can choose from different types of coffee (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino) and purchase them.
  The coffee will only be dispensed if there are enough ingredients in the machine.

* Fill Ingredients: The maintainer can refill the coffee machine with water, milk, and coffee beans.
  The amounts are specified by the user.

* Take Money: The maintainer can collect the money from the machine's money box.

* Show Ingredients: Users can check the current levels of water, milk, coffee beans, and the amount of money in the machine.

* Analytics: The machine provides analytics on the number of coffees sold, total earnings, and ingredient consumption.

* Exit: Users can choose to exit the simulation.

## Usage

* Run the program: Start the Coffee Machine Simulator by executing the provided script or opening the application.

* You will be prompted with a list of actions: buy, fill, take, show, analytics, exit.
  
* Select a coffee: Choose from the available coffee options, which include Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino. Each coffee type has its price, water, milk, and coffee bean requirements.
